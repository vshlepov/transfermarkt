# transfermarkt

Here's the story. I just needed some data to play with in scikit - tired a bit of irises, different cancer types, etc. Transfer statistics is a reasonable choice, i thought. Unforunatelly I found no API to get data from the transfermarkt, may be I just missed one, whatever. So, I just put together a few lines of code to scrape all required data, namelly - transfer attributes, player attributes and statistics, and club attributes and statistics. Worth to mention that I'm far from being advanced user of python, beautifulsoup, pandas and everethitg - pretty sure that the code could be twice more compact and fast.
