# transfermarkt

Here's the story. I just needed some data to play with during my applied machine learning calss, but the basic options offered be scikit were kind of extremums on the "beauty/beast" scale - either irises (lovely flowers, you know) or different cancer types. Football (the original one, soccer) transfer statistics appealed to me as reasonable choice in a given circumstances - way less scary as compared to cancer, at least. Unforunatelly I failed to find  any API to get data from the transfermarkt.com, maybe I just missed one, whatever. So, I just put together a few lines of code to scrape all required data, namelly - transfer attributes, player attributes and statistics, and club attributes and statistics. Worth to mention that I'm far from being advanced user of python, beautifulsoup, pandas and everethitg - pretty sure that the code could be twice more compact and fast.
